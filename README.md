# traefik-for-windows
UPDATE: As traefik is now officially published on all supported Windows versions, this repo is no longer needed

Dockerfile for modern Windows OS

This is the plain Traefik proxy as it comes from Traefik Labs. The intention of this repo is only to make Traefik container images for Windows available on modern base images until maybe a better solution for https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues/9198 is found
